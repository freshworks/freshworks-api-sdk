## Make changes in a codespace

For more information about using a codespace for working on GitHub documentation, see "Working in a codespace." Before making any changes kindly explore supported [contribution options](contribution-docs/options.md)

- Create a working branch and start with your changes!
- Commit your update in your branch. Commit the changes once you are happy with them.
- Once your changes are ready, don't forget to self-review to speed up the review process⚡.

## Pull Request

- When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so the branch can be updated for a merge.
- Once you submit your PR, a person from DevRel team will review your contribution.
- We may ask questions or request for additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can apply [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork/branch, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
