# Contributing to API-SDK Project

Welcome to Freshworks API SDK contributing guide. Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on [API-SDK Docs](https://developers.freshworks.com/api-sdk/).

Check our [contribution options](docs/contributing/options.md) to see what types of contributions we accept before making changes. Read our [contribution guidelines](docs/contributing/guidelines.md) to adhere to our documentation standards.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from adding new API specification, adding a new endpoint, adding a new API method, adding test cases, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## Make changes in a codespace

For more information about using a codespace for working on GitHub documentation, see "Working in a codespace." Before making any changes kindly explore supported [contribution options](docs/contributing/options.md)

- Create a working branch and start with your changes!
- Commit your update in your branch. Commit the changes once you are happy with them.
- Once your changes are ready, don't forget to self-review to speed up the review processâš¡.

## Pull Request

- When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so the branch can be updated for a merge.
- Once you submit your PR, a person from DevRel team will review your contribution.
- We may ask questions or request for additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can apply [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork/branch, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
