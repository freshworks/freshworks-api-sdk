# Freshworks API SDK

Node.js SDK for working with Freshworks HTTP APIs. Currently supports Freshteam.
This repository is currently in closed beta (current version < 1.0.0).

## Installation

```
npm install --save @freshworks/api-sdk
```

## Supported product APIs

| Product     | Status  |
|-------------|---------|
| Freshteam   | âœ…      |


## Get started

```js
const { Freshteam } = require("@freshworks/api-sdk");

const ft = new Freshteam(domain, apiKey);
```

Call a method, e.g., list all employees (who match a search criteria):

```js
const employees = await ft.employees.list({ firstName: "Arthur", lastName: "Dent" });
```

# Freshteam

## Models

The `Freshteam` class includes a static property called `models`. All models used by the API methods below can be accessed from there.

For example:

```js
// Create a new EmployeeCreate model to pass to employees.create() method
const newEmp = new Freshteam.models.EmployeeCreate("Arthur", "Dent", "arthur@heartofgold.com", [300060409]);
```

## API methods

API methods are the methods you'd interact primarily with. Each method is `async` and returns a `Promise`. So, you can either chain the method calls with `.then()` or call them using `async/await` syntax.
