## Get started

This section depicts example of using different API capabilities offered with examples

### Freshteam

This section depicts example of interacting with Freshteam API

```js
const { Freshteam } = require("@freshworks/api-sdk");

const ft = new Freshteam(domain, apiKey);
```

Call a method, e.g., list all employees (who match a search criteria):

```js
const employees = await ft.employees.list({ first_name: "Arthur", last_name: "Dent" });
```

### Freshservice

This section depicts example of interacting with Freshservice API

```js
const { Freshservice } = require("@freshworks/api-sdk");

const fs = new Freshservice(domain, apiKey);
```

Call a method, e.g., remove a Freshservice Ticket

```js
// Delete ticket with given ticket ID
const ticket_id = 14000239432;
const delTicket = await fs.tickets.delete(ticket_id);
```

- The first argument is the ticket ID - identifier of the ticket to be deleted
- Returns a `Promise`
