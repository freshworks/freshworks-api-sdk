## Install

### Installing in a Node.js project

Installing in a Node.js project needs you to install the [`@freshworks/api-sdk`](https://github.com/freshworks/freshworks-api-sdk) package:

```sh
npm install --save @freshworks/api-sdk
```

### Installing in a Freshworks app

To use this library in a Freshworks app, add the following to the `"dependencies"` object in `manifest.json`:

```js
{
  // ...
  "dependencies": {
    "@freshworks/api-sdk": "0.3.0"
  }
}
```

The Freshworks CLI (`fdk`) will fetch the dependency next time you run `fdk run`.
