# Tickets

A ticket can be an incident or a service request. An incident is a disruption to an existing service, and a service request is a formal request from a user for something to be provided. Tickets are assigned to agents based on the agent's expertise and on the subject of the ticket.

## Ticket

const query = {
  email: "******@freshservice.com",
  filter: "watching",
  include: "stats",
