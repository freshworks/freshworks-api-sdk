# Conversations

Conversations consist of replies as well as public and private notes added to a ticket. Notes are non-invasive ways of sharing updates about a ticket amongst agents and requesters. Private notes are for collaboration between agents and are not visible to the requester. Public notes are visible to, and can be created by, both requesters and agents.

> **_NOTE:_**  Support for Conversations API will be added soon.
